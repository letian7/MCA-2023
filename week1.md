   The reason I choose Violin Sonata as my dataset is because I be attracted by the elegant and classic sound made by violin when I first time listen this. In all instrument, I like the violin and piano best, the sounds of these two instruments captivated me. And I always lisen the Sonata for Violin Solo in No.1 in G minor, this is why I choose this as my dataset. <br>
