## week1 taskï¼šmusical dataset
### Theme
   My theme for this dataset is Sonata for Violin and Piano. It has many famous creater, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. Mozart composed several violin sonatas, including the famous "Sonata in B-flat major, K. 454." and Beethoven's violin sonatas, such as the "Violin Sonata No. 9 in A major, Op. 47"

   <br>
   The reason I choose Violin Sonata as my dataset is because I be attracted by the elegant and classic sound made by violin when I first time listen this. In all instrument, I like the violin and piano best, the sounds of these two instruments captivated me. And I always lisen the Sonata for Violin Solo in No.1 in G minor, this is why I choose this as my dataset. <br>
