## Analysis
The revised score successfully identified the original's BPM and certain patterns. Yet, it differs significantly from the original in terms of notation and sound. This indicates that automatic transcription isn't entirely dependable and needs thorough review before use. Moreover, further study is necessary to improve the automatic transcription process, potentially incorporating machine learning techniques.
