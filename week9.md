## Analysis
Examining the three produced histograms reveals a noticeable distinction between the initial two tracks and the final one. Specifically, the histogram for the third track shows lower levels compared to the first two. This implies that when listening, the third track is expected to sound different from the others. The lower levels in the histogram suggest variations in aspects like volume, intensity, or other acoustic characteristics, potentially leading to a unique auditory experience with the third track compared to the more similar first two.
